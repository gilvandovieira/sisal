# Sisal package architecture

Sisal is, and will remain, a **JSR-first, Deno-native, SQL-first, type-safe**
toolkit for **relational** data access, with matching npm packages for Node.js
24+. It is not becoming an object-first ORM. As the surface grows from OLTP
query building toward ETL and analytics, the packages stay strictly layered so
the OLTP core never pays for the analytical ambitions.

The package graph is registry-neutral: JSR publishes `@sisal/*`, npm publishes
the same package set and versions as `@sisaljs/*`, and the dependency-direction
rules below apply to both distributions.

This document describes the package graph and the one rule that keeps it honest.
The release roadmaps (`v0.6` → `v0.11`) stage the work that gets us here. See
the [roadmap overview](roadmap.md) for sequencing.

## Workload model, not a compliance protocol

Sisal distinguishes **OLTP** (transactional, row-at-a-time, latency-sensitive
reads/writes) from **OLAP** (analytical, set-at-a-time, scan/aggregate-heavy) as
**workload models that shape an API**, not as standards to certify against. The
query builder is tuned for OLTP; ETL bridges OLTP data into OLAP-ready shapes;
analytics queries those shapes. Each is a thin, typed layer over the same core
primitives.

```

- **Analytics depends on `@sisal/core`** and executes through a structurally
  injected adapter database. It must not import `@sisal/orm`, adapters, drivers,
  migrate, or ETL runtime code.
- **ETL's job model and SQL compilation depend on `@sisal/core`;** its runner
  consumes the v0.9 checkpoint/advisory-lock substrate from `@sisal/orm` and
  executes through an injected adapter database.
- **`@sisal/orm` must never depend on ETL or Analytics.** The OLTP core stays
  clean; an app that only does CRUD pulls in none of the analytical surface.
- **Adapters never import each other** and expose their **dialect capabilities**
  explicitly (see [v0.9](v0.9.0-roadmap.md)).

### v0.9 ETL substrate lives in `@sisal/orm` (A3 decision held)

The v0.9 correctness substrate a future `@sisal/etl` runner consumes — the
portable advisory run lock (`Database.tryAdvisoryLock`, T11) and the
checkpoint/watermark helper (`etlCheckpoint`, T12/T13) — ships in
**`@sisal/orm`**, not `@sisal/migrate`. Both need the `Database` facade
(`execute`/`insert`/`batch`) that lives in `@sisal/orm`, and neither reaches
into migrate, so the v0.6 **A3 decision holds: there is no `etl → migrate`
edge.** The `sisal_etl_checkpoints` and `sisal_advisory_locks` system tables are
created and managed by these ORM helpers at runtime
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on first use) — not by the migration snapshot/DDL
pipeline, so a job's checkpoint is not part of the user's migrated schema and
never appears as drift the migrator owns. When `@sisal/etl` is built (v0.10) it
consumes these primitives from `@sisal/orm` (adding an `etl → orm` runtime edge
alongside `etl → core`); the substrate does not move. Watermarks are stored as
opaque TEXT, so the checkpoint carries no per-adapter timestamp-type surface to
reconcile.

## Where we are today (the honest baseline)

As of v0.11 development, **`@sisal/core` exists** as the extracted lower tier
and `@sisal/etl` exists as the first downstream package that compiles into it.
`@sisal/analytics` is being built as the second: a typed semantic layer over
core expressions/windows and the core statement assembler. Core owns the schema
primitives/snapshots, SQL fragment IR, expression operators, capability
registry, renderer, structured errors, and logger contracts. The fluent
builders, `Database` facade, relations, and typed function caller remain in
`@sisal/orm`, which re-exports the full core surface so existing imports keep
working.

The split follows the layering confirmed by the June 2026 code audit:
`errors ← sql ← {operators, columns} ←
table ← {builders, relations} ← database`.
The lower tier (`errors`, `sql`, `operators`, `columns`, `table`, `temporal`,
and the schema snapshot leaf) has **no upward edges** into the OLTP builders.
The one cross-cut — embedding a query builder as a subquery fragment — remains
inverted behind the `QUERY_BUILDER_BRAND` symbol + a structural `SubquerySource`
interface, exposed only through `@sisal/core/unstable-internal` for the ORM
tier.

**Important nuance for ETL/analytics:** what `@sisal/core` exposes is a
dialect-agnostic **fragment/expression IR plus a serializable schema snapshot**
— a _compile target_, not a transformable relational AST. Downstream packages
can **build and render** parameterized SQL/predicates on it, but query
_introspection/rewriting_ (predicate pushdown, plan optimization) does not exist
today and would be new core work if a milestone genuinely needs it (flagged in
[v0.8](v0.8.0-roadmap.md)).
